# Suds-E-Commerce-Website
Daily UI Challenge

Designing an E-commerce page was a part of the Daily UI challenge (Day 12)

Suds is a fictional company that sells products (soaps) and services (soap-making classes).
I chose a soap company because I want to learn how to make soaps and the art involved really facinates me.
